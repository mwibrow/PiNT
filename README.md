# PiNT üêÑ

**PiNT** is an [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/)
app for performing picture naming task experiments.

## Building

To get going quickly, install the latest version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
for the relevant platform.

Change to the project root and execute:

    npm install

After a while (and possibly a bunch of warnings depending on the platform)
execute:

    npm run electron:dev

## Using PiNT

Set the source folder for the pictures and the destination folder
for the recordings on the Settings. Recordings will be saved
inside timestamped folders inside the destination folder.

## Acknowledgements

This project would never have got off the ground without
[angular-electron](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron).
